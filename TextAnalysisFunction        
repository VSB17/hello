Example of Letters to a Friend Enlightening her with the Cultural Festival of India, and telling him/her how grand the celebration was. Many people want to know that how Diwali is being celebrated. Some want to join, or sometimes want to invite. For all the above purposes, we need to explain how a Diwali event is observed, or How we celebrate Diwali. We try to explain best. But if you want to add more, please write in the comments. Further, we also created some letters explaining the Diwali event.

Sample  Letter to Inform a Friend About Recent Diwali Experience
To,

Dear Elisa Smith, NY

I hope you are doing well. I am also fine. As you know, I am in India these days because of Diwali. I am writing this letter to tell you that how my first Diwali in India went. So, my arrival was wonderful; all my maternal cousins came to the airport to receive us. We went to our grandmother’s house, and all my aunts and uncles were staying with us. We all bought traditional Indian dresses and bought many firecrackers as well. As I was encountering firecrackers for the first time, I was afraid, but later I enjoyed it. We had grand Pooja at our place after that we all ate sweets and had delicious Indian food. After that, we got money from the elders.


We saved the money because we all cousins decided to go to fun land. At night we all played games and had so much fun with firecrackers. The next day, my cousins left as their schools were started, but we really had a lot of fun. Now I have realized that celebrating your cultural events in your home country gives you a very special feel instead of celebrating it in another country. I really missed you because you are my only best friend, and I could not resist writing you my experience over here. I am coming back to London next week, and then I will show you all the pictures I have captured here. I am really going to miss this place. I want to stay more, but I have to come back because of school and my father’s job.

Give my regards to everyone at home. See you soon.

Regards

Your best friend Misha

Dear friend

Hello, how are you?

I hope you find this letter in good health. I received your letter yesterday in which you repeatedly asked me about how I celebrated my Diwali in England. Well, at first, even I thought I might not be able to celebrate it here knowing fireworks are illegal to crack in here but then all the society’s head from my university begged our vice-chancellor to let us celebrate this occasion even for two to three hours. Finally, after a lot of begging, and convincing she gave in, and that’s how we started our preparation to celebrate Diwali. First of all, my girlfriends and I went out to shop for some traditional dresses, and on Diwali eve, we got ready in entirely cultural attire with some heavy Indian jewelry. When we reached the venue, we were welcomed with loudspeakers bursting the top Bollywood songs of the year.

You know, whenever I hear a Bollywood song staying still turns into a challenge for me. So we danced for about an hour on all the biggest hits of the year, and soon after that, the event manager asked us to join him on the main ground where all the stocks for fireworks were present. Although we were just allowed to play with the small stuff, it was still a lot of fun. In the end, they started the biggest fireworks I have ever seen till yet it was so magnificent to see little colorful sparkles of fire bursting into the sky for merely a second but giving such a breath-taking view. It was one of the most memorable nights of my life. I have sent you the pictures as well to see what a fantastic event it was. I am sure you also had tons of fun celebrating it in India, and I hope you missed me there because I missed you here.

Love,

Rachel
